# Json_Builder
## A GUI for making simple JSON


Use JSON-GUI.html to create your JSON for nunjucks\
\
The input folder from the old Nunjucks can be copied to the new input folder. The only difference will be that this new method uses a json file rather than xlsx.

## Setting up /clients folder
This program needs a /clients subfolder for assets. The easiest way is with symbolic links (symlinks)

### Windows Command
From the parent folder of 'intdev-nunjucks':

mklink /j "intdev-nunjucks/clients" "NunjucksClients"

### MacOS Command
From the parent folder of 'intdev-nunjucks':

ln -s "intdev-nunjucks/clients" "NunjucksClients"

## Using the JSON Builder

1. Open JSON-GUI.html in your browser
2. (Optional) If you have created client settings, select them in the dropdown.
3. Either load a local JSON file or start from scratch in the builder.
4. When the data is ready, save the JSON file as '{{clientName}}/input/data/{{clientName}}.json'.

Replace {{clientName}} with the name of the client

## Create new client folders
After running the command to create folders('node render.js --client={{clientName}}'), a folder will be created for that client with some default input files to get started. 

[Refer to the Nunjucks documentation](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html) to learn more about setting up HTMLs with Nunjucks.

## Generating Templates
Templates can be re-generated by re-running the render command: 'node render.js --client={{clientName}}'
